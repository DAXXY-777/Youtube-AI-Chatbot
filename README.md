# Youtube-AI-Chatbot

## Overview
This Python script is a chatbot designed for YouTube live streams. It uses the YouTube Data API to interact with live chat messages and integrates AI capabilities via the `OllamaLLM` from LangChain. The AI provides witty, multilingual responses to user commands like `!ai` and supports other commands such as `!hello`, `!discord`, and `!socials`.
